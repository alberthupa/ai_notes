Briefing Document: Key LLM Research Trends in 2024

Introduction

This document summarizes key research trends and findings in the field of Large Language Models (LLMs) throughout 2024, as highlighted by Sebastian Raschka in his "Noteworthy LLM Research Papers of 2024" article. The document focuses on twelve influential papers selected by Raschka, representing a variety of advancements in model architecture, training techniques, data, and practical applications. The selection is subjective but aimed for variety beyond just model releases.

Key Themes and Findings by Month:

1. January: Mixture of Experts (MoE)

Key Paper: Mixtral 8x7B (Mistral AI)
Main Idea: Explores Sparse Mixture of Experts (SMoE) models, which use multiple smaller "expert" subnetworks within the LLM architecture to handle different types of tasks or tokens. This approach allows for more efficient resource allocation and scaling of LLMs by activating only a subset of parameters for each input.
Quote: "MoE architectures are still relevant, especially as they offer a way to scale large language models efficiently by activating only a subset of the model’s parameters for each input, thus reducing computation costs without sacrificing model capacity."
Relevance: While not as widely adopted as initially expected, MoE is still relevant for efficient scaling of LLMs.
2. February: Weight-Decomposed LoRA (DoRA)

Key Paper: DoRA: Weight-Decomposed Low-Rank Adaptation
Main Idea: Extends the popular Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) method for parameter-efficient LLM finetuning by decomposing the weight matrix into a magnitude vector and a directional matrix. DoRA applies LoRA-style updates only to the directional matrix, allowing more flexibility in finetuning.
Quote: "Rather than uniformly scaling both magnitude and direction as LoRA tends to do, DoRA can make subtle directional adjustments without necessarily increasing the magnitude. The result is improved performance and robustness…"
Relevance: Offers improved performance and robustness compared to standard LoRA with fewer parameters and less sensitivity to the rank used.
3. March: Continual Pretraining Strategies

Key Paper: Simple and Scalable Strategies to Continually Pre-train Large Language Models
Main Idea: Emphasizes simple but effective techniques for continually pretraining LLMs to incorporate new knowledge, such as using the same learning rate schedule from the initial pretraining, and adding a small percentage of the original training data to the new dataset to prevent catastrophic forgetting.
Quote: "Simple re-warming and re-decaying the learning rate. Adding a small portion (e.g., 5%) of the original pretraining data (D1) to the new dataset (D2) to prevent catastrophic forgetting."
Relevance: Demonstrates practical and straightforward methods for continued learning in LLMs.
4. April: DPO vs PPO for LLM Alignment

Key Paper: Is DPO Superior to PPO for LLM Alignment? A Comprehensive Study
Main Idea: Compares Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), two Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) methods for aligning LLMs with human preferences. PPO tends to outperform DPO but DPO is simpler to implement and more computationally efficient.
Quote: "The key conclusions are that PPO tends to outperform DPO, and that DPO is inferior when dealing with out-of-distribution data."
Relevance: Highlights a trade-off between performance and ease of implementation in LLM alignment, with current trends leaning towards using both.
5. May: LoRA Learning & Forgetting

Key Paper: LoRA Learns Less and Forgets Less
Main Idea: Formalizes common knowledge about LoRA by demonstrating that LoRA learns less than full finetuning but also forgets less previously acquired knowledge. The benefit of full finetuning is higher for new knowledge, particularly if further from the pretraining domain, while LoRA excels at preserving original capabilities.
Quote: "Full finetuning is better for absorbing new knowledge from more distant domains but leads to more forgetting of previously learned tasks. LoRA, by changing fewer parameters, learns less new information but retains more of the original capabilities."
Relevance: Shows a tradeoff between learning and forgetting when fine-tuning LLMs, guiding which approach is best in specific circumstances.
6. June: FineWeb Dataset

Key Paper: The FineWeb Datasets: Decanting the Web for the Finest Text Data at Scale
Main Idea: Describes the creation of a publicly available 15 trillion token dataset for LLM pretraining. This large dataset, the result of detailed studies in filtering the CommonCrawl corpus, enables training large LLMs for the research community.
Quote: "...the 15 trillion tokens in the FineWeb dataset should be optimal for models up to 500 billion parameters according to the Chinchilla scaling laws."
Relevance: Provides a substantial public resource for democratizing LLM development and training large-scale models, with better quality than other comparable options like RedPajama.
7. July: Llama 3 Family of Models

Key Paper: The Llama 3 Herd of Models
Main Idea: Highlights advancements in the Llama 3 architecture, training, and post-training, marking increased sophistication over Llama 2 with increased vocabulary, grouped query attention, a multi-staged training process including 15 trillion tokens, and a switch to DPO for post-training.
Quote: "What’s notable about the Llama 3 model family is the increased sophistication of the pre-training and post-training pipelines compared to its Llama 2 predecessor."
Relevance: The Llama 3 models represent a significant and widely used family of open-weight LLMs, demonstrating strong performance and ease of use. Iterations on the Llama 3 model have been a focus throughout the year.
8. August: Scaling Inference-Time Compute

Key Paper: Scaling LLM Test-Time Compute Optimally can be More Effective than Scaling Model Parameters
Main Idea: Investigates how increasing test-time computation can improve LLM outputs. Techniques include generating multiple solutions and selecting the best with a verifier model, and adaptively revising the model's response distribution during inference.
Quote: "They found that for challenging questions, larger models outperform smaller models that get additional inference compute via the inference scaling strategies discussed earlier. However, for easy and medium questions, inference time compute can be used to match the performance of 14x larger models at the same compute budget!"
Relevance: Highlights that improving outputs via increased inference-time compute is possible, especially for smaller models, and should be a focus for LLM deployment and on-device applications.
9. September: Multimodal LLM Paradigms

Key Paper: NVLM: Open Frontier-Class Multimodal LLMs
Main Idea: Compares two main multimodal LLM approaches: a unified embedding-decoder architecture (NVLM-D) and a cross-modality attention architecture (NVLM-X). Nvidia proposes a hybrid architecture that leverages both methods (NVLM-H).
Quote: "The hybrid model (NVLM-H) combines the strengths of both approaches: it first accepts an image thumbnail as input, followed by a dynamic number of patches processed through cross-attention to capture finer high-resolution details."
Relevance: A direct comparison of two main approaches that leads to the recommendation of a hybrid approach, given that multimodal LLMs are gaining importance and support.
10. October: Replicating OpenAI's O1 Reasoning

Key Paper: O1 Replication Journey: A Strategic Progress Report – Part 1
Main Idea: Hypothesizes that OpenAI's O1 models employ "journey learning" where training encompasses the entire trial-and-error correction process instead of just focusing on the correct steps ("shortcut learning"). This requires the construction of a long, step-by-step thought process including both correct and incorrect steps.
Quote: "Traditionally, LLMs are trained on the correct solution path (shortcut learning); in journey learning, the supervised finetuning encompasses the whole trial-and-error correction process."
Relevance: Proposes a novel approach to improving LLM reasoning by training the model on a thought process that resembles real human problem solving.
11. November: LLM Scaling Laws for Precision

Key Paper: Scaling Laws for Precision
Main Idea: Extends the Chinchilla scaling laws to account for training and inference in low-precision settings, providing a new understanding of how precision affects model performance, especially when combined with the amount of training data.
Quote: "...the researchers extend the original Chinchilla scaling laws by adding a “precision” factor P. Concretely, they reinterpret the model parameter count N as an “effective parameter count” that shrinks as the precision decreases."
Relevance: It demonstrates that models trained on more and more data become harder to quantize to lower precision formats after training, thus highlighting that the "more data is better" approach should be balanced with the practical constraints of efficient inference.
12. December: Phi-4 and Synthetic Data

Key Paper: Phi-4 Technical Report
Main Idea: Demonstrates that models trained primarily on synthetic data generated by GPT-4o can outperform those trained on non-synthetic data, highlighting the potential of using synthetic data for LLM pretraining. However, synthetic data alone is not sufficient and a mix with other data improves the results.
Quote: "The researchers observed that while synthetic data is generally beneficial, models trained exclusively on synthetic data performed poorly on knowledge-based benchmarks."
Relevance: The research into synthetic data is highly relevant given the discussion about "LLM scaling being over" because of the saturation of the web data. It highlights that synthetic data and data curation will become more and more important.
Conclusions and Outlook for 2025

Multimodal LLMs: Multimodal support will become standard, and open-source efforts will increase, but text-only models will still suffice for many use cases, with the focus on reasoning.
Computational Efficiency: Focus on developing techniques to improve LLM computational efficiency, including Mixture of Experts, grouped-query attention and dynamic byte-based input encoding.
State Space Models: State space models will continue to evolve, likely integrating self-attention mechanisms from transformers.
Scaling: Gains from scaling via data may plateau; focus on post-training techniques and data curation.
Personal Predictions: Looking forward to Llama 4 release and experimenting with special-purpose finetuning rather than general chatbots, and continued interest in code and math-specific models.
Overall

2024 has been a highly productive year for LLM research, with many advancements in model architecture, training methods, and the use of data. These trends suggest a continued focus on improving model efficiency, capabilities, and practical application across different modalities. The research indicates that there is no single solution but rather an integrated approach that combines model architecture, data curation, training methods, and careful model evaluation, especially around their utility and cost.

This briefing document provides a comprehensive overview of the key research themes of 2024 and should be useful for anyone interested in following the developments in this rapidly evolving field.
